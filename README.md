This repository contains all the scripts from project ViRVANA, which I have implemented since August 2024. (to present 24/4/2025)

ViRVANA is a third-person shooter with flight movement developed in Unity using C#.

Features:
1. character state system to handle complex movement, combat, and animations states.
2. addressables and object pooling for optimization practices.
3. player progression skill tree.
4. enemy ai behavior with overridden class for variant behavior.
